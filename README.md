# kosu!(legacy)
### This project has been **abandoned** in favor of the successor, <a href="https://github.com/konekowo/kosu-ts/">kosu!-ts</a>.
I have decided to abandon this project as Unity is just not made for rhythm games and doesn't perform well in the browser. 
I needed something way more performant, responsive, and specialized, so I made a <a href="https://github.com/konekowo/kosu-ts/">new project</a> using a custom version of <a href="https://github.com/konekowo/pixijs/">Pixi.JS</a> I made that handles raw cursor input, unlike Unity.
<a href="https://github.com/konekowo/kosu-ts/">kosu!-ts</a> is also much more performant and resembles real osu! laser much more than kosu!(legacy) as this time, I'm actually trying to get <a href="https://github.com/konekowo/kosu-ts/">kosu!-ts</a> looking the exact same as osu! laser, even going as far as translating
osu! laser code to TypeScript and Pixi.JS so that <a href="https://github.com/konekowo/kosu-ts/">kosu!-ts</a> almost the same as osu! laser.
